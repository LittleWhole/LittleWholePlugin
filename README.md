# LittleWhole's Plugin
LittleWhole's Plugin is a multipurpose, all-in-one plugin, providing simple commands and utilities to make the experience easier.

LittleWhole's Plugin is the perfect plugin for servers who don't want to stray too much from vanilla Minecraft mechanics.

LittleWhole's Plugin is a great alternative to Essentials.
